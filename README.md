# Intermediate Python Course

Hey there, 

In this course you will create a dice-rolling program using python. The code you create will be stored in the dice-roller.py file. This repo also contains course materials under the issues tab. 

***
I completed this project and I am looking to add some more features.

Already added
- Player names
- Storing player totals in a list and determining the winner(s) from the list

To be added
- Another file simulating a dice-based game in Python
